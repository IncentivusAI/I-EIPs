# I-EIPs / Incentivus Improvement Proposals

Welcome to the Incentivus Improvement Proposals (I-EIPs) repository. This repository serves as the central location for submitting, discussing, and tracking proposals for changes and improvements to the Incentivus protocol.

# What are I-EIPs?

An Incentivus Improvement Proposal (I-EIPs) is a technical design document providing information to the Incentivus community or describing new features for the Incentivus protocol and its surrounding ecosystem. An I-EIP should present a clear rationale and a concise technical specification for any underlying features described in the proposal. I-EIPs are intended to serve as the primary mechanism for proposing new features and changes, gathering community input on an issue, and documenting design decisions that affect the protocol.

# Types of I-EIPs

- **Core:** Proposals affecting the core Incentivus protocol and consensus rules, including consensus forks and key protocol changes.

- **Networking:** Proposals for peer-to-peer protocols, node interactions, and network infrastructure.

- **Interface:** Proposals for APIs, CLI, UI standards, and contract interfaces.

- **Application (ERC):** Proposals for application-level standards, including tokens, registries, URIs, libraries, and account abstraction.

- **Meta:** Proposals about processes, governance, or changes to the Incentivus proposal system.

- **Informational:** Proposals providing guidance or information without introducing new features.

# I-EIPs Lifecycle

I-EIPs go through several stages before they are finalized:

- **Draft:** The initial version of an I-EIP submitted as a pull request. This stage is open for discussion and community feedback.

- **Review:** The I-EIP has passed the preliminary check and is now formally reviewed by the editors and the community.

- **Last Call:** The I-EIP is almost ready for approval, with a designated period for final comments and objections.

- **Final:** The I-EIP is complete and either implemented or ready for implementation.

- **Stagnant:** The I-EIP has not been updated for a long time or lacks community consensus, and is considered inactive.

- **Withdrawn:** The author has chosen to remove the I-EIP from consideration.

- **Living:** The I-EIP is continuously updated with new information, such as coding standards or best practices.

# How to Submit I-EIPs

1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. **Create a new file** in the bits/ directory named I-EIP-XXXX.md, where XXXX is the next available I-EIP number. You can use an existing I-EIP as a template.  
3. **Fill in** the file with your proposal details.  
4. **Submit a pull request** with your new I-EIP. The title should be "I-EIP-XXXX: [TEST]" where XXXX is your proposal number.  
5. **Participate in the discussion**: Respond to feedback from the community and I-EIP editors during the review process.

# I-EIPs Numbering

Although I-EIP numbers are assigned in sequence, they are not always finalized in that order. Some lower-numbered I-EIPs may remain open while higher-numbered ones are approved more quickly.

# Roles and Responsibilities

- **Author:** The individual who wrote and is responsible for the I-EIP.  

- **Editor:** A community member responsible for ensuring that I-EIPs are clear, concise, and adhere to the repository's standards. Editors do not decide on I-EIP approval but help facilitate the process.  

- **Reviewer:** Any community member who reviews and gives feedback on I-EIPs during the Draft and Review stages.

# FAQs

**What is the purpose of I-EIPs?**  
I-EIPs are the main method for proposing new features or changes to the Incentivus protocol, promoting open-source collaboration, transparency, and structured decision-making.

**How are I-EIPs approved?**  
I-EIPs gain approval through community consensus during the Review and Last Call stages. Editors guide the process but do not make approval decisions alone.

**Can I update I-EIPs after they are finalized?**  
Once finalized, I-EIPs are generally considered complete. Living I-EIPs are an exception and can be updated continuously with new information, such as standards or best practices.
