## Abstract
A brief (~200 words) summary of the problem being addressed and the proposed solution.

## Motivation
Explain why the current Incentivus protocol or ecosystem is insufficient to address this problem. Clearly describe why the proposed solution benefits the Incentivus community and ecosystem.

## Specification
Provide a detailed technical description of any new feature or change. The specification should be precise enough to allow implementation without needing to infer intent.

## Rationale
Explain why the chosen design decisions were made, discuss alternative designs and why they were not selected, and describe the potential impact on the existing system.

## Backwards Compatibility
Describe any backward incompatibilities introduced by this I-EIP, their severity, and how they are handled. I-EIPs without sufficient discussion of backward compatibility may be rejected.

## Reference Implementation (Optional)
If available, provide a link to a reference implementation demonstrating the feasibility of the proposal. This can be partial or complete.

## Security Considerations
Discuss potential security risks, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities introduced by this proposal, and how it impacts the overall security of the Incentivus protocol.
